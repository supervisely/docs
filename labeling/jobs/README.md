# Labeling Jobs

Labeling jobs is a powerful tool for efficiently organizing and distributing data annotation tasks within a [team](../../collaboration/teams.md). It is designed to ensure that annotators work on well-defined and manageable portions of the [dataset](../../data-organization/project/datasets/datasets.md), follow consistent guidelines, and contribute to the overall success of the annotation project while maintaining data quality and accuracy. It is a critical component of effective team coordination in data annotation efforts.

## Using Labeling Jobs: Step-By-Step Guide

{% hint style="info" %}
**Before you start**

Make sure that you have:

* dedicated Team assigned with proper roles
* necessary projects for annotation with relevant properties (clasess/figures/tags) defined
{% endhint %}

### Step 1. Create a Labeling Job

1. Navigate to the Labeling Jobs tab. 🗂️
2. Assign a title and provide a detailed description for Annotators.
   * Use Markdown or Labeling Guides for detailed instructions with images or videos.
3. Assign Reviewers and Annotators.
4. Select the data to annotate.
5. Define available classes, tags, and any restrictions (e.g., max figures per item).
6. Filter data by criteria like tags or item count. By default, the entire dataset is selected for annotation.
7. Complete setup to redirect to the Labeling Jobs page, where tasks are listed for each Annotator.

### Step 2. Complete the Job

Annotators should:

1. Read technical specifications.
2. Use the annotation toolbox to label data with predefined classes.
3. Confirm the task is completed and submit it for review.
4. Once submitted, the job is marked as completed and removed from the Annotator’s list.

### Step 3. Review and Quality Control

Reviewers follow these steps:

1. Read technical specifications.
2. Review annotations in the annotation toolbox. 🛠️
   * Accept (👍) or Reject (👎) the work.
3. Finalize the Labeling Job if all data is reviewed.
   * Rejected annotations are sent for re-annotation in a new Labeling Job. 🚀
