# Labeling Queues

Labeling Queues is a systematic method for distributing and managing labeling process in a [team](../../collaboration/teams.md), where labeling tasks are grouped into queues and sequentially distributed among annotators. The essence of this system is that the data is not distributed between annotators, but is issued from a common queue (pool) of tasks, on a "whoever labels first" basis, until there is no more data to label. This allows to balance data annotation process within the labeling team independently of the speed of individual workers.
