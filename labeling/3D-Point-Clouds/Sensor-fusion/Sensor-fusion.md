{% endhint %}

Additionally to a [single point cloud](../3D-Point-Clouds.md) and [episodes point clouds](../3D-Point-Clouds-episodes-1.md) toolboxes, Supervisely allows you to provide additional photo and video context for accurate labeling.

Supervisely automatically calculates correlation between 3D space and 2D context and projects your labeled objects on it, letting you achieve unprecedented quality of labeling.”
