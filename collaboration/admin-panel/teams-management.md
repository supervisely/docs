# Teams management

Administrators can manage teams through the admin panel. To access it:

* Click the **Settings** option in the bottom-left corner of the interface.
* Select the **Teams** option from the dropdown menu.

## Team List

The team list provides administrators with an overview of all registered teams and their activities. After selecting **Teams**, a list of all teams will appear. For each team, the following information is displayed:

* **Team Name:** The name assigned to the team.
* **Created:** The date and time when the team was created.
* **Team Icon:** A visual identifier for the team.

#### Customizing the Team List Display

Administrators can refine the displayed data to focus on specific information. Each column in the team list can be filtered or sorted:

* Filter teams by their **Created Date** to locate recently added or older teams.
* Adjust sorting criteria for the **Team Name** column to organize teams alphabetically.

Regularly reviewing the team list helps maintain an organized and efficient workspace.
