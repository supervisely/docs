#### Customizing the Team List Display

Administrators can refine the displayed data to focus on specific information. Each column in the team list can be filtered or sorted:

* Filter teams by their **Created Date** to locate recently added or older teams.
* Adjust sorting criteria for the **Team Name** column to organize teams alphabetically.

Regularly reviewing the team list helps maintain an organized and efficient workspace.
