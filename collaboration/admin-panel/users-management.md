## User list

**The list helps administrators quickly review user details and activity.**

After selecting **Users**, a list of all registered users will appear. For each user, the following information is displayed:

* **Login**: Username of the user.
* **Email**: Associated email address (if provided).
* **Datasets**: Number of datasets the user has access to.
* **Tasks**: Number of tasks completed by the user.
* **Registered**: Time and date of user registration.

Administrators can customize the user list display to filter or focus on specific information. Each column in the user list can be filtered to refine the displayed data. For example, you can:

* Filter users by their email type (e.g., None, Free, Corporate, Educational) using the dropdown in the **Email** column.
* Adjust sorting or filtering criteria for columns like **Login**, **Datasets**, **Tasks**, or **Registered** to organize and prioritize information.
