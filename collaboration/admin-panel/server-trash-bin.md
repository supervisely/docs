# Server trash bin

The **Server Trash Bin** serves as a temporary holding area for deleted items. It allows users to review and manage deleted projects, datasets, and workspaces before permanently removing or restoring them. This ensures data is not accidentally lost and provides a second chance to recover items when needed.

**Prevent Data Loss**: Temporarily store deleted items to avoid accidental permanent deletion.

**Enable Recovery**: Restore deleted items if needed.

**Facilitate Cleanup**: Permanently delete unneeded items to free up storage space.
