Deploying in Kubernetes is an advanced topic and requires a strong working knowledge of Kubernetes. This guide is intended for experienced Kubernetes users who want to deploy Supervisely in their Kubernetes cluster.

There are two ways to integrate Supervisely with Kubernetes:

* [Deploy all Supervisely components in a Kubernetes cluster](installation/)
* [teawd](installation.md#installation)
* [test2](agent.md)
* [Connect a Kubernetes cluster with a Supervisely server for Supervisely Apps deployment](agent/)
