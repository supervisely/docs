# 🤖 What's Supervisely

**Supervisely** is computer vision platform for researchers and companies to annotate and manage datasets, train neural networks and much more.

Unlike other platforms, Supervisely is [built like OS](./ecosystem/ecosystem.md): instead of having a huge monolith, Supervisely creates a foundation for developing and running applications called Supervisely Apps.

Supervisely is available [online](https://app.supervisely.com/signup) for free, as well as an on-premise edition for enterprises.

### With Supervisely you can


* [Label](labeling/Labeling-toolbox.md) **images**, **videos**, **3D point clouds**, **volumetric slices** and other data in the best labeling toolboxes.

* **Manage** and **track** annotation workflow at scale with [teams](./collaboration/teams.md), workspaces, roles and [labeling jobs](labeling/jobs/README.md).

* **Train** [neural networks](./neural-networks/overview/overview.md) on your custom datasets or use pre-trained models to speed up manual labeling.
