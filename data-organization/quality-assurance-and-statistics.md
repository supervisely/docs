## Class Balance

A proper understanding of the class distribution in your dataset is essential for effective model training and evaluation. Class distribution analysis highlights the prevalence and rarity of different annotation classes, enabling you to address class imbalance directly impacts the performance and generalization capacity of neural networks.

Class imbalance occurs when some classes are over-represented while others are under-represented in the dataset. This imbalance can lead to biased model training, where the neural network performs better on common classes and poorly on rare ones. By analyzing and adjusting the class distribution, you can ensure balanced learning and robust model performance.

Class imbalance table helps you to adjust and modify data sampling algorithms during training to automatically normalize classes distribution.

* Click on any row to explore all images containing objects of the selected class.
* Use the search function to quickly filter and find specific classes.
* Sort by specific columns to identify the rarest or most frequent classes.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/class-balance-frame.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Components**:

The class statistics table provides a comprehensive overview of the dataset. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of each column in the table:

**Class**: Lists the annotation classes present in the dataset. Datasets can contain a large number of classes, in some cases 1000+. To view all available classes, just scroll the rows.

**Images**: Shows the total number of images containing at least one object of the given class.

**Objects**: Presents the total number of objects of the corresponding class in the dataset.

**Average Count on Image**: Provides the average number of objects per image for a specific class, excluding images without such objects.

**Area on Image**: Indicates the average image area occupied by objects of the given class, excluding images without such objects.

## Co-Occurrence Matrix

The Co-Occurrence Matrix is an analytical tool that reveals how frequently pairs of classes appear together in the same images within a dataset. It provides insights into potential interactions and correlations between classes, which can be crucial for understanding the dataset's structure and improving model performance.

In image datasets, certain classes may co-occur frequently, indicating a semantic or contextual relationship. For instance, in a dataset of animal images, classes like "cat" and "dog" might appear together often due to their common domestic environment.

In case of analyzing custom neural network performance, this matrix is called **confusion matrix** - where the rows are actual classes in the ground truth data and the columns are predicted classes. The Confusion Matrix compares the actual classes (ground truth) with the predicted classes by the model. For example, a cell at the intersection of the actual class "cat" (row) and the predicted class "dog" (column) with a value of 7 indicates that the model misclassified 7 "cat" objects as "dog".

* Click on any cell in the matrix to access corresponding annotated images containing objects from both classes. This feature facilitates understanding of class interactions by allowing users to explore visual examples of identified relationships.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/co-occurrence-matrix-frame.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Components**:

**Matrix Cells:** Each cell in the matrix represents the co-occurrence of two classes. The number within the cell indicates the number of images containing objects of both classes simultaneously.

**Tooltip Explanations:** Hovering over a cell reveals a tooltip explanation, making it easy for new users to interpret the matrix values and draw right conclusions.

## Per Image Statistics

Analyzing images in the dataset based on the number of annotations for each class provides valuable insights into the distribution and characteristics of object instances. By examining the annotations per image across various classes, users can identify anomalies, edge cases, and patterns that may influence model performance and dataset quality.

* Sort the table by any column to identify anomalies or edge cases, such as images with a high number of annotations of specific class or unusual object distributions.
* Quickly locate specific images or classes of interest within the dataset.
* Clicking on any row in the table allows users to preview the selected image with labels, allowing them to instantly locate an object or class of interest in the dataset.

The `Images` table provides detailed information about each image contained in the dataset:

**Image** - Each image is identified by a unique name or identifier.

**Split** - Images are categorized based on the dataset split they belong to, such as training, validation, or test.

**Dimensions** - Height and width dimensions of each image are provided in pixels, aiding in understanding the scale and resolution of the dataset.

**Object Information** - Detailed statistics on objects within each image are listed. This includes for every class in a dataset the number of objects presented on the image and the total area covered by those objects.

## Object Distribution Heatmap

The Object Distribution Heatmap offers an interactive visualization of how objects are frequently presented across images for every class in the dataset. This heatmap chart exposes the images with unusual number of objects, facilitating detailed exploration and analysis of class annotations.

For example, let's consider the row for class `train` (Y axis) and the column 3 objects (X axis). The cell on the intersection has the value 2 which means that there are only **2 images with 3 objects of class `train` simultaneously** in our training dataset.

Once user hovers the mouse cursor over the cell, the helpful tooltip appears on the screen supporting users in interpretability and understanding of the selected value.

Clicking on that cell would display a list of all images in your dataset that contain only 3 objects labeled as `train`. This functionality enables users to quickly identify images with the exact number of object for a particular class.

* Clicking on a cell in the heatmap displays a list of images containing the specified number of objects for the selected class. This feature allows users to explore specific object distributions and analyze the corresponding images in detail in a thumbnail preview mode or open them in the image annotation toolbox.
* Users have the option to download the heatmap chart in various formats, including `SVG`, `PNG`, and `CSV`, for further analysis or documentation purposes.

## Spatial Heatmap

The heatmaps below show the average spatial location of all objects for each class. These visualizations help to understand how objects are distributed on the images highlighting most common and rare object locations. It helps to analyze the placement of objects in a dataset.

These statistics are mostly relevant for spatial datasets for such Computer Vision tasks as object detection, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, panoptic segmentation, etc. For example,m as you can see on the image below, objects of class `airplane` are mostly located in the center of the image. Knowing that information will help data scientists to configure custom data augmentations to train the model that will be robust to `airplane` locations, and as a result will be able to predict airplanes on any position, not only in the center of the image.

* Hovering on heatmap provides detailed insights into spatial object distribution.
* Export options allows downloading of heatmaps for detailed study and presentations.

**Width (%/px):** Specifies the width of the object relative to the width of the image, expressed as a percentage or pixels.

**Area:** Shows the area occupied by the object, expressed as a percentage. This metric provides insight into the extent of coverage in the image.

## Image Tags Co-Occurrence

The co-occurrence matrix for [image and object tags and attributes](https://supervisely.com/blog/mastering-image-tagging/) provides a rich analytical view of the relationships between different tags and attributes associated with both images and objects in a dataset. It provides a comprehensive overview into how different tags and attributes tend to co-occur, shedding light on potential correlations and trends in the data.

Also it help to find the images that have both tab "A" and "B". It help on analyzing datasets for image and object classification Computer Vision task. In you work in the settings of classical classification, you may find the mistakes in your datasets - co-occurence matrix has to be diagonal. For the multi-label classification it uncovers the correlation between all tag pairs. Find the example below for the [MVTec Logical Constraints Anomaly Detection dataset](https://datasetninja.com/mvtec-loco-ad).

* Each cell in the matrix represents the co-occurrence of two tags or attributes. The numeric value in the cell indicates the number of images in which the pair of tags (attributes) co-occur.
* Hovering over a cell provides a tooltip that shows the degree of co-occurrence between the tags (total number of images).
* Clicking on any cell in the matrix allows users to view corresponding images containing the selected pair of attributes.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/co-occurrence-matrix-tags-frame.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>



## Objects Tags Co-Occurrence

The objects tags co-occurrence matrix provides a detailed analytical view of the relationships between various tags associated with objects in a dataset. It offers a comprehensive understanding of how different tags tend to co-occur, revealing potential correlations and trends in the data.

This tool is particularly useful when analyzing datasets for object classification tasks in computer vision. In classical classification settings, errors in your datasets can be identified if the co-occurrence matrix is diagonal. For multi-label classification tasks, the matrix helps uncover correlations between all pairs of tags. For example, in the MVTec Logical Constraints Anomaly Detection dataset, each cell in the matrix represents the co-occurrence of two tags. The numeric value in the cell indicates the number of images in which the pair of tags co-occur.

* Hovering over a cell provides a tooltip that shows the degree of co-occurrence between the tags (total number of images).&#x20;
* Clicking on any cell in the matrix allows users to view the corresponding images containing the selected pair of tags.

## Class To Tags Co-Occurrence

The class and tag association statistic provides a comprehensive view of the associations between different classes, their objects and tags assigned to the objects. This matrix shows the big picture on which tags are commonly associated with objects of specific classes, allowing users to understand the semantic relationships between the object classes and the descriptive attributes assigned to them.

In Computer Vision datasets for object multi-label classification tasks objects on images may have more than one tag assigned, certain tags may frequently co-occur with particular classes, indicating the descriptive attributes commonly associated with those classes. For example, in a dataset of live-stock images, the class `cow` may be associated with tags such as `age`, `size`, `health condition` and `pose type` which reflect the typical characteristics of the cows for animal health and well-being monitoring systems.

Class and tag co-occurrence matrix provides a powerful way to explore relationships between objects and the attributes assigned to them.

## Categorical Tags Distribution

In Supervisely, you can create [categorical (OneOf) key-value tags](https://supervisely.com/blog/mastering-image-tagging/#types-of-tag-values) and use them in various Computer Vision tasks, such as image retrieval and classification. These tags have the defined set of possible values. For every tag in the dataset, categorical tag distribution chart shows the number of objects and images, that contain this tag with its specific value. This chart provides a clear view of how frequently different values of the categorical tags occur in the dataset. All cells are clickable and the corresponding images with their annotations will be opened in dialog window in thumbnails preview mode.

Analyze occurrences of categorical key-value tags (OneOf) assigned to images or objects. The row for every tag includes itâ€™s all possible values and shows the number of images or objects containing corresponding tag with this specific value.&#x20;

Note that you can always change the applicability of tags (images or objects) in the `Tags` tab.
