# Data usage & Cleanup

One of the important clarifications. [Team Files](../team-files/) is an exception and it needs to be cleared specifically from Team Files and the deleted files will not go to the trash bin and they cannot be recovered.

### Disk usage

To view disk usage in current team you can visit **Disk usage** page.
