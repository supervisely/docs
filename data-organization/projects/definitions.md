  The Definitions tab allows you to manage all the classes and tags used for
  annotation tasks in the project. In this section you can create, edit and
  delete classes and tags.

# Definitions

The **Definitions** tab consists of two main categories:

1. **Classes** - management object classes.&#x20;
2. **Tags** - management of tags for data annotations.

## Classes & Tags: Distinctions <a href="#tags--classes-distinctions" id="tags--classes-distinctions"></a>

Although both tags and classes are used to identify objects, they serve distinct purposes:

* **Classes:** Represent clear categories that an object belongs to, such as "car", "truck", or "bus" for vehicles.
* **Tags:** Provide specific information about objects or images, such as context or properties. Tags are more flexible and can include details not tied to formal classifications.

An image or an object can have multiple Tags assigned, while each object usually belongs to a single class, i.e. classes are used to explicitly categorize objects. Tags can be more personalized and focused on specific characteristics and attributes. Tags typically add context and descriptive attributes not necessarily related to the formal classification of an object.

Tags provide a more flexible and free way to describe, while classes provide a formalized structure for training models.

## Classes

The **Classes** category is intended for creating and managing object classes that are used to annotate data in a project.

* **TITLE** ‚Äî the name of the class. The name should be unique and clearly describe the object, for example, "person," "car," or "tree."
* **SHAPE** ‚Äî the annotation shape for the class (e.g., Bounding Box to mark an object within a rectangular frame).
* **COLOR** ‚Äî the color assigned to the class, displayed on the screen to visually differentiate the annotation.
* **HOTKEY** ‚Äî a shortcut key assigned to the class for quick annotation during labeling.



Classes are pre-defined types of your annotations (i.e. "Background" or "Tumor"). Thus, every labeled object on image or video frame has exactly one class associated.

Usually, you define classes before labeling starts, but you can add new classes in the labelling interface on-fly (if you have enough permissions, of course).

If you delete the class, then the objects drawn by this class are disabled, and they can later be restored using the restore mode function.

## Shape

You can limit tools that can be used to create an instance of a class by setting a class **Shape**. For example, if you select a raster shape, the annotator might use Brush or Smart Tool for the object, but not Polygon. This can be very helpful in big projects and guarantee that your data scientists won't need to convert Cuboids to Polygons two months after labeling is finished.

If you don't want to constrain the shape, set it to **Any Shape** - this way you can create "Cars" from both polygons and bitmaps.

## Hotkey

Optionally, you can assign a Hotkey for a class to quickly select it during labeling. You can only set a single latin character (because other combinations may be unavailable).

Sometime you need more than a bunch of marked pixels on an image. You may need to associate some extra information with annotations or files. For example, you may want to label what type of defect on a road is that or point out that this image should be selected for training. To structure this, you can define a Tag.

A Tag defines a name, possible values for a tag instance and what types of things it can be attached to. Usually, you can't attach a particular Tag to a particular object multiple times.

## Key features of Tags:

1. **Data Annotation:** Tags help annotate images by associating specific information with objects or areas within an image.
2. **Classification Tool:** Tags enable grouping of images or objects based on their characteristics, facilitating classification tasks.
3. **Data Search:** Tags reflect key characteristics, allowing users to search for and navigate to relevant data easily. They help refine queries and focus searches, particularly in large and complex datasets.
4. **Neural Network Training:** Tags are used in training neural networks to understand patterns and make accurate predictions. They assist in data annotation, dataset splitting, and performance assessment.
5. **Data Organization:** Tags improve data organization and streamline workflows across various industries, such as healthcare and agriculture.

## Classification Task in Supervisely

For a practical demonstration, watch our 3-minute video tutorial on using tagging tools in the Supervisely platform, which covers:

* Creating tags of different types
* Manual and automated annotation
* Assigning tags to images and objects
* Using a ready-to-use ecosystem of apps for computer vision classification tasks

## Types of Tag Values

1. **None (Tag without Value):** Used to flag specific properties. For example, a tag "train" might mark data for neural network training.
2. **Text Tag:** Contains textual descriptions or comments about the object or image.
3. **Number Tag:** Represents numeric properties, useful for regression tasks (e.g., size, weight).
4. **One of:** Indicates that the value must be one of a predefined set, such as colors (Red, Blue, Green).

## Image Tags vs. Object Tags

**Image Tags:** Apply to images and provide information like category, properties (resolution), geographic details, and content.

**Object Tags:** Apply to objects within images, detailing characteristics (e.g., "broken" equipment), state (e.g., "ripe" fruit), and localization (e.g., "anterior" placenta).

</div>

Some tags can be applied to both images and objects. Such Tags may describe both image characteristics and individual objects at the same time, providing comprehensive labeling.

## Hotkey

Optionally, you can assign a Hotkey for a tag to quickly select it during labeling. You can only set a single latin character (because other combinations may be unavailable).

## Filtering

Tags can be later used to filter out images or objects in the labeling interface or define a labeling jobs to annotate files that are marked with a particular tags

## How to Use Tags in Supervisely

### Creating Tags

1. **Select Project:** Choose the project you want to work with.
2. **Access Tags Tab:** Click the Tags tab at the top of the interface.
3. **Create New Tag:** Click the + New button to start creating a tag.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/tags-tab-frame.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Specify Parameters:**

* Name the tag
* Create a hotkey for quick assignment
* Select a color
* Define the application scope (Images, Objects, or both)
* Choose possible value types

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/create-tags-frame.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### Applying Tags

1. **Select Image or Object:** Choose the item you want to tag.
2. **Assign Tag:** Use the drop-down list to select and apply the tag.
3. **View/Edit Tags:** You can view and edit applied tags and create new ones from the Image Labeling Toolbox.

### Multiple Tags Mode

To apply the same tag multiple times:

1. **From the Project:** Go to Settings > Tags and find Multiple Tags Mode.
2. **From the Image Labeling Toolbox:** Click on the Tag icon, hover over üîÅ, and click the blue link Setting to enable Multiple Tags Mode.

### Visualization Settings

Adjust how tags are displayed:

* **Always:** Tags are visible directly on images or objects.
* **Show on Hover:** Tags display only when hovering over the annotated object.
* **Show When Selected:** Tags appear only when the object is selected.

Additional options include displaying the object class name and the author of the label.

## Examples

* "probability" (of "Number" type) ‚Äî automatically attached to the generated labels during inference
* "to\_train" (of "None" type) ‚Äî can used for filtering to automatically move those images to the training set
* "bad\_one" (of "None" type) ‚Äî especially with a hotkey attached, can be used to quickly mark images that needs to be re-labeled
* "color" (of "String" type) ‚Äî describes some information about an object
