# Import using API & SDK

Our software provides you with a Software Development Kit (SDK), which equips you with tools and resources to optimize data import processes. With the SDK, you can create custom solutions that best suit your needs.

## **How to Use the Software Development Kit (SDK):**

1. Access the SDK for our system and its [documentation](https://supervisely.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sdk\_packages.html).
2. Utilize the SDK to create custom solutions that align with your specific needs.
3. Integrate customized applications and solutions into your system to optimize data import.

By using the Software Development Kit (SDK), you gain a powerful tool for optimizing data import and creating custom solutions that align with your unique needs and goals. This makes the data management process more efficient and effective.

## **How to Import Through APIs:**

Our system offers the flexibility to integrate data from various sources using Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). This powerful feature enables seamless data transfer and management, connecting our platform with external systems or services.

1. Access the [API documentation](https://api.docs.supervisely.com/) for our platform to understand the available endpoints and data import methods.
2. Configure your data source to connect with our platform's API.
3. Use API requests to initiate data transfer, specifying the data you want to import and its destination within our platform.

Importing data through APIs allows for seamless and automated data transfer, making it an ideal choice for integrating external data sources with our system. It empowers you to have more control over your data management and ensures data consistency and efficiency.
