You can also import data into an existing project or dataset as follows:

{% hint style="info" %}
Depending on the [Supervisely App](https://app.supervisely.com/ecosystem/all-apps), some of them (not every application!) support additional context, such as Input Project or Input Dataset. You can look for it in the Run Application modal window, but there is a more simple way.
{% endhint %}

Go to the **Projects** or **Data** page, select any dataset and use the context menu by **three dots icon (⋮)** and select Add more items → Import. You find the list of [Supervisely Apps](https://app.supervisely.com/ecosystem/all-apps) that support project as an input and allow adding more content to it.

## Example: add more images to a dataset

Step 1: Go to the **Data** page

Step 2: Select Add more items → Import → Import Images

Step 3: Drag and drop additional images you want to add and click `Run App` button.

Step 4: You will be redirected to the **Tasks** page where you can watch import progress. When it is done, you will see the link to your updated project (or find it at the Projects page).
