You can also import data into an existing project or dataset as follows:

{% hint style="info" %}
Depending on the [Supervisely App](https://app.supervisely.com/ecosystem/all-apps), some of them (not every application!) support additional context, such as Input Project or Input Dataset. You can look for it in the Run Application modal window, but there is a more simple way.
{% endhint %}

Go to the **Projects** or **Data** page, select any dataset and use the context menu by **three dots icon (⋮)** and select Add more items → Import. You find the list of [Supervisely Apps](https://app.supervisely.com/ecosystem/all-apps) that support project as an input and allow adding more content to it.
