# Data Commander

Data Commander is a tool that combines the classic approach of file management with the modern needs of handling data for training Computer Vision models. The primary goal of this tool is to simplify and speed up data manipulation processes by providing an interface similar to traditional file managers like Double Commander or Total Commander, but tailored to the specific requirements of working with annotations and other training data components.

Data Commander is a dual pane data manager (just like Double Commander), but not files â€” it's for training data.

## What you can do with Data Commander:

* Explore your teams, workspaces, projects and datasets
* Get insights and statistics about your data

With over 30 columns of metadata (such as the number of labels of different shapes, the source of the image, etc.), Data Commander helps users better understand the structure and quality of their data, which is crucial for preparing the most accurate and reliable neural network models.

* Move, copy, rename and remove your stuff
* Create new items, like teams
* Do batch operations, like tagging

Easily move and copy data between projects and workspaces, supporting standard functions such as renaming, deleting, and creating new items. It's particularly useful for handling large amounts of data, as batch operations can be performed using keyboard shortcuts.

* Quickly preview images

Data Commander allows you to quickly preview images without having to open the full annotation interface. This helps to quickly analyze data, identify problems, and make decisions about further processing.
