# Prediction API

Suppose you've trained a new model in Supervisely and want to use it for inference. You can do this with ease using the new **Supervisely Prediction API**.

## Connect & Deploy

Before using the model, you need to connect to it. You can either deploy a new model or connect to an existing one.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Deploy model" %}
```python
import supervisely as sly

api = sly.Api()

model = api.nn.deploy_custom_model(
    checkpoint_id=12345,  # file id of checkpoint in Team Files
)
```
{% endtab %}
{% tab title="Connect to existed model" %}
```python
import supervisely as sly

api = sly.Api()

model = api.nn.connect(
    task_id=12345,  # Task ID of a running app in Supervisely
)
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Predict

After you've connected to the model, you can use it to make predictions. The model can accept various input formats, including image path, np.array, Project ID, Image ID and others.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="sly.Annotation" %}
```python
# Predicting multiple images
predictions = model.predict(
    input=["image1.jpg",  "image2.jpg"],
)

# Iterating through predictions
for prediction in predictions:
    labels = prediction.annotation.labels  # üî¥üî¥üî¥ labels - —Ç–µ—Ä–º–∏–Ω –≤ –∫–æ–Ω—Ç–µ–∫—Å—Ç–µ –º–æ–¥–µ–ª–µ–π –æ–±—ã—á–Ω–æ –∏—Å–ø–æ–ª—å–∑—É–µ—Ç—Å—è –¥–ª—è –æ–±–æ–∑–Ω–∞—á–µ–Ω–∏—è –Ω–æ–º–µ—Ä–∞ –∫–ª–∞—Å—Å–∞.
    boxes = [label.geometry.to_bbox() for label in labels]
    masks = [label.geometry for label in labels]
    scores = [tag.value for tag in labels.tags if tag.name == "confidence"]
    classes = [label.obj_class.name for label in labels]
```
{% endtab %}
{% tab title="!NEW API!" %}
```python
# Predicting multiple images
predictions = model.predict(
    input=["image1.jpg",  "image2.jpg"],
)

# Iterating through predictions
for prediction in predictions:
    boxes = prediction.boxes  # List of predicted boxes (xyxy format)
    masks = prediction.masks  # List of predicted masks (np.ndarray)
    scores = prediction.scores  # List of predicted probabilities

### Output format

The `predict()` method returns a list of `Prediction` objects, containing annotation data and information about the source image.

```python
# Predicting multiple images
predictions = model.predict(
    input=["image1.jpg",  "image2.jpg"],
)

# Iterating through predictions
for prediction in predictions:
    prediction.annotation    # sly.Annotation with predicted objects
    prediction.source        # Source of an image. Will be "image1.jpg" or "image2.jpg" in this example
    prediction.image_path    # Path to the image file
    prediction.image_url     # URL of the image if input was a URL
    prediction.image         # np.ndarray image if input was a numpy array
    prediction.project_id    # Project ID if input was a Supervisely ID
    prediction.dataset_id    # Dataset ID if input was a Supervisely ID
    prediction.image_id      # Image ID if input was a Supervisely ID
    image = prediction.load_image()    # Load the original image associated with this prediction
    visualization = prediction.draw()  # Draw the predicted annotation on the image
```

#### `Prediction` attributes

The `Prediction` object contains the following attributes:

| Attributes | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `annotation` | `sly.Annotation` | Supervisely annotation containing predicted objects, their classes, geometries, and tags. |
| `source` | `str` or `np.ndarray` | The source of a single input image. Depending on the type of `input`, it can be **image path**, **np.array** of the image, or **URL**. |
| `image_path` | `str` or `None` | Path to the image file. Applicable if the input was a local path or directory |
| `image_url` | `str` or `None` | URL of the image if the input was a URL. |
| `image` | `np.ndarray` or `None` | Image as a numpy array if the input was a numpy array. |
| `project_id` | `int` or `None` | ID of the Supervisely project associated with this prediction. Applicable if the input was a Supervisely ID |
| `dataset_id` | `int` or `None` | ID of the Supervisely dataset associated with this prediction. Applicable if the input was a Supervisely ID |
| `image_id` | `int` or `None` | ID of the image in the Supervisely platform associated with this prediction. Applicable if the input was a Supervisely ID |

#### `Prediction` methods

The `Prediction` object provides methods for loading the original image and visualizing the predicted annotation.

| Method | Return Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `load_image()` | `np.ndarray` | Loads the image associated with this prediction. |
| `draw()` | `np.ndarray` | Draws the predicted annotation on the image. |


### Predict Detached

The `predict_detached` method provides an asynchronous, non-blocking approach to running predictions on large datasets or when processing needs to be done in parallel with other operations. Unlike the standard `predict()` method which blocks execution until **all** predictions are complete, `predict_detached` returns a `PredictionSession` object immediately, allowing your application to process predictions as they become available. This can be useful in tracking the progress, or doing other tasks while the predictions are being processed.

```python
from tqdm import tqdm

# Start a detached prediction session
# At this point, the model will start making predictions in parallel
session = model.predict_detached(
    input="path/to/directory",
    recursive=True,
)

# Process predictions as they become available
for prediction in tqdm(session):
    objects = prediction.annotation.labels  # List of predicted objects
    boxes = [label.geometry.to_bbox() for label in labels]
```

#### `PredictionSession` methods

| Method | Return Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `is_done()` | `bool` | Returns `True` if all predictions have been processed or the session was stopped. |
| `next(timeout=None, block=True)` | `Prediction` | Retrieves the next available prediction. If `block=True`, waits until a prediction is available or the timeout (in seconds) is reached. If `block=False`, returns `None` immediately if no prediction is available. |
| `stop()` | None | Stops the prediction process. Any predictions already in the queue will still be available, but no new predictions will be generated. |
| `status()` | `dict` | Returns a dictionary containing session status information including: `progress` (percentage complete), `message` (status message), `error` (traceback if an error occurred), and `context` (project_id, dataset_id, etc.). |
