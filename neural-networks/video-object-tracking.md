# Video Object Tracking

Object tracking is a critical task in computer vision, aiming to predict the position of a given target object in each video frame. It's used in various applications such as robotics, video surveillance, autonomous vehicles, human-computer interaction, and augmented reality. This guide provides an overview of the best AI models, tools, and methods for efficient object tracking in videos, addressing common challenges and confusion in the field.

### Object Tracking Overview

#### What is Visual Object Tracking?

Visual Object Tracking involves predicting the position of a target object in each frame of a video. The primary subtasks in Visual Object Tracking include:

* **Single Object Tracking (SOT)**
* **Multiple Object Tracking (MOT)**
* **Semi-Supervised Class-Agnostic Multiple Object Tracking**
* **Video Object Segmentation (VOS)**

#### Why Object Tracking is Challenging

Creating custom datasets for tracking is labor-intensive. For example, a one-hour video at 24 frames per second contains 86,400 frames. If each frame contains 8-12 objects, this results in about a million objects to track. Automating this process with AI models and tools can significantly reduce the workload.

### Types of Object Tracking

#### Single Object Tracking (SOT)

SOT involves tracking one object throughout the video based on a manual annotation on the first frame. The annotation, called a template, is used by a neural network to locate the object in subsequent frames. These models are class-agnostic, meaning they can track any object based on the initial annotation.

**Key Models and Tools:**

* **MixFormer (CVPR2022)**
* **TransT (CVPR2021)**
* **Supervisely Video Labeling Toolbox**

#### Multiple Object Tracking (MOT)

MOT detects and tracks multiple objects of predefined classes, estimating their trajectories. The process involves two steps: detecting objects in each frame and associating detections across frames to form tracklets. This approach is known as the Tracking-by-Detection paradigm.

**Key Models and Tools:**

* **YOLOv8**
* **DeepSort Algorithm**
* **Supervisely Apps: Serve YOLO, Apply NN to Videos Project**

#### Semi-Supervised Class-Agnostic Multiple Object Tracking

This approach combines the simplicity of SOT with the ability to track multiple objects. By applying an SOT model to each object on the first frame, users can track and correct multiple objects simultaneously, enhancing annotation speed and accuracy.

#### Video Object Segmentation (VOS)

VOS tracks objects in videos using masks instead of bounding boxes. The user labels the object mask on the first frame, and the model segments and tracks the object in subsequent frames.

**Key Models and Tools:**

* **XMem Model**
* **Segment Anything Model**

### Step-by-Step Guide to Object Tracking

#### Single Object Tracking (SOT) Using Supervisely

1. **Label the First Frame**: Annotate the target object with a bounding box on the first frame.
2. **Track Automatically**: Use a class-agnostic neural network to track the object in subsequent frames automatically.

**Tools:**

* MixFormer
* TransT
* Supervisely Video Labeling Toolbox

#### Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) with YOLOv8

1. **Object Detection**: Use a detection model like YOLOv8 to predict bounding boxes on each frame.
2. **Tracking Algorithm**: Apply a tracking algorithm (e.g., DeepSort) to link detections and form object trajectories.

**Tools:**

* YOLOv8
* DeepSort Algorithm
* Supervisely Apps: Serve YOLO, Apply NN to Videos Project

#### Semi-Supervised Class-Agnostic Multiple Object Tracking

1. **Apply SOT to Each Object**: Use an SOT model to track each object from the first frame.
2. **Correct and Re-track**: Correct tracking predictions and re-track objects as needed.

#### Video Object Segmentation (VOS)

VOS is a computer vision task aimed at segmenting all pixels of specific target objects throughout all frames in a video. This task, often referred to as Semi-Supervised VOS, involves the user annotating objects on the first frame, after which the neural network tracks and segments these objects in subsequent frames.

**Tools and Models:**

* **Segment Anything Model (SAM)**
* **XMem Model**

**Steps:**

1. **Connect GPU to Supervisely**:
   * Use a single command in the terminal to connect your personal computer with GPU to the Supervisely account.
   * Watch this [1.5-minute how-to video](https://example.com).
2. **Run Segment Anything Model (SAM)**:
   * Deploy the SAM for fast object segmentation on the first frame.
   * Start the app, select a pre-trained model, and deploy via the GUI.
   * Interactive segmentation allows users to provide feedback to the model by marking positive and negative points on the image.
3. **Run XMem Model**:
   * Serve the XMem model on a computer with GPU.
   * Go to the Neural Networks page and select the XMem model for video segmentation.
4. **Segment and Track Objects on Videos**:
   * Use the video labeling toolbox to select objects and track masks in subsequent frames.
   * Apply the tracking algorithm and review results.

**Key Features of XMem Model:**

* **State-of-the-art Performance**: Excels on long-video datasets and matches top methods on short-video datasets.
* **Real-time Processing**: Efficiently tracks objects with minimal GPU memory usage.
* **Handles Complex Scenes**: Effective in challenging conditions such as occlusions, object deformation, and rapid motion.
