# Run pre-trained models

You can deploy your trained model in Supervisely with just a click or pick one of the ready-to-use pre-trained models from the [Ecosystem](https://ecosystem.supervisely.com/). Search for “Serve …” Supervisely App and run the model on one of your agents. Now, use API to communicate with the model or use one of our Supervisely Apps that helps you apply the model in various scenarios, such as running the model on each image in the dataset or integrating it in the Labeling Toolbox.

## Some examples of pre-trained models:
