If you want to run Docker images from your own registry, for example, to develop and run private applications, you can use the following methods:

### Local docker images
Put your Docker image on the computer where the agent is running. When the application starts, agent will find this image and run it.


### User account settings
This method is better for you if you want only specific users to have access to Docker registry credentials.


Open "Account Settings" -> "Registries" -> click the "Add" button. Fill in the form and click "Add registry".

In order for agent to have access to the registry from your account, go to the "Team Cluster" page -> open agent "Instructions" -> click "Advanced settings" and enable "Add my Docker credentials" setting. Next, copy the command and run it on the server where the agent is running.
