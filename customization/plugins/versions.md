## Plugin Updates and Versioning

Supervisely plugins are complex tools, often deeply integrated and dependent on each other to function properly. That is often why your plugins need to be reguraly updated, as even a smmaler change or a new fuctionality added to even one element of the platform can require a series of consequent changes needed to be implenented in sometimes seemingly disconnected parts of the platfom. The great things about this is that the update process is very easy and that all the earlier plugin versions are preserved inside the platform.
